				LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE APP

On every round one random word is chosen - question asked to the player. 
We show player english word with english keyphrase.
We also provide 3 answers - shown to user in Spanish - chosen randomly from 11 words provided (one of them is translation of previously randomly chosen word).

The game consists of 3 rounds. If the user chooses the wrong answer the game is finished.
